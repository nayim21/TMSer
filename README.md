In this type of analysis, the data points are arranged in chronological order, and the objective is to identify patterns, trends,
and relationships within the data. Time series analysis is commonly used in various fields, including economics, finance, weather forecasting, and signal processing.

The primary goal of time series analysis is to understand the underlying structure and characteristics of the data, as well as to make predictions 
or forecasts about future values based on historical patterns. It involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, model identification and estimation, 
model diagnostics, and forecasting.
